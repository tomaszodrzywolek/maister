# Visual Companion

Documents the browser-based visual companion architecture for the product-design orchestrator. Provides high-fidelity visual feedback by rendering HTML/CSS mockups in a browser during design sessions.

---

## Purpose

Terminal-based ASCII mockups are useful but limited. For UI-focused design tasks, seeing actual rendered HTML/CSS in a browser gives qualitatively better feedback. The visual companion provides this without requiring any external tools, npm packages, or design software.

**Core idea**: Orchestrator generates HTML/CSS, sends to a local server, browser renders it, user reviews and provides feedback in the terminal. Browser is read-only visual output -- all interaction stays in the terminal via ask_user_question.

---

## Architecture Overview

```
Orchestrator → POST /update → Node.js Server → SSE "refresh" → Browser (renders mockup)
                                                                   ↓ user views
                                                              Terminal (ask_user_question)
```

**Data flow is one-directional**: Orchestrator pushes content to server, server pushes to browser, user reviews in browser, feedback flows through terminal. The browser never sends data back to the orchestrator.

---

## Zero-Dependency Principle

The server uses ONLY Node.js built-in modules: `http`, `fs`, `path`, `url`. No npm install required. No package.json needed.

**SSE over WebSocket**: Server-Sent Events replace WebSocket for simplicity. SSE works with the native browser `EventSource` API, requires no client library, and handles reconnection automatically. One-directional push (server to browser) is all we need.

**Why zero-dependency matters**: The visual companion starts inside a product-design workflow. Requiring `npm install` would add failure modes, slow down startup, and create version compatibility issues. Node.js built-in modules are sufficient for a local development server.

## Communication Protocol

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Request/Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/status` | GET | Health check | Response: `{"status":"ok","version":"1.0.0"}` |
| `/` | GET | Current mockup | Response: HTML page with mockup wrapped in template |
| `/events` | GET | SSE stream | Response: `text/event-stream`, sends `data: refresh\n\n` on update |
| `/update` | POST | Push new mockup | Body: `{type, title, html, css, annotations}` |

### POST /update Body Schema

```json
{
  "type": "mockup",
  "title": "Settings Page - Desktop",
  "html": "<div class='settings'>...</div>",
  "css": ".settings { padding: 1rem; }",
  "annotations": [
    {"selector": ".settings", "text": "Reuses existing card component"}
  ]
}
```

**Annotations**: Positioned tooltips overlaid on mockup elements. Togglable via the "Annotations" button in the UI header (on by default, preference persists via localStorage). Use for component reuse hints, integration points, and interaction hints — NOT for feature descriptions or requirements.

Example annotations:
- `{"selector": ".patient-card", "note": "Reuses existing <PatientCard> component"}`
- `{"selector": ".save-btn", "note": "Triggers webhook notification"}`
- `{"selector": ".drag-handle", "note": "Drag to reorder"}`

---

## Lifecycle

### Startup

1. Spawn server process: `node ${SKILL_DIR}/server/index.mjs`
2. Port allocation: try 3847, fallback through 3848-3850
3. Verify ready: poll `GET /status` until ok (timeout after 3 seconds)

### Browser Opening

1. **Primary**: Playwright MCP `browser_navigate` (if configured)
2. **Fallback 1**: `open` command (macOS) / `xdg-open` (Linux)
3. **Fallback 2**: Log URL for manual opening, continue with terminal-only review

### Teardown

Kill server via `POST /shutdown` endpoint on:
- Workflow completion (Phase 8 sends POST /shutdown after final approval)
- Workflow cancellation

**PID file**: Server writes its PID to `{taskPath}/analysis/mockups/.visual-companion.pid` on startup. Cleaned up on shutdown, SIGTERM, and SIGINT. Enables reliable process identification.

**Stale server detection**: Phase 7 checks `/status` before starting a new server. The response includes `taskPath` — if it belongs to a different task, the server is stale and gets shut down via `POST /shutdown` before starting a new one.

## Graceful Degradation Matrix

The visual companion is an enhancement, not a requirement. Every failure has a fallback.

| Scenario | Detection | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js not available | `which node` fails | ASCII mockups via ui-mockup-generator agent |
| Port 3847 in use | Server startup error (EADDRINUSE) | Try ports 3848-3850, then ASCII fallback |
| Playwright MCP not configured | MCP tool call fails | Log URL for manual browser opening |
| Browser fails to open | Playwright error + open command error | Log URL, continue with terminal-only review |
| Server crashes mid-session | `GET /status` returns error or timeout | Restart server; if 2nd failure, ASCII fallback |
| No issues | `GET /status` returns ok | Full visual companion experience |

**Degradation principle**: Never block the design workflow because the visual companion failed. The core design conversation happens in the terminal. Visual rendering is additive value.

## HTML Template Pattern

The server wraps mockup content in a base template that provides:

- **Viewport meta**: Responsive rendering matching common device widths
- **CSS reset**: Minimal reset so mockup styles render predictably
- **SSE client script**: `EventSource` connection to `/events` with auto-reconnect on disconnect
- **Annotation overlay script**: Renders positioned tooltips from annotation data
- **Placeholder state**: "Waiting for design mockup..." shown before first `POST /update`

**Template is server-side, not orchestrator-side**: The orchestrator sends only the mockup `html` and `css`. The server wraps it in the template. This keeps the orchestrator focused on design content rather than boilerplate.

**Auto-refresh behavior**: When the SSE stream receives a `refresh` event, the page reloads to fetch the updated mockup from `GET /`. No manual refresh needed.

---

## Integration with Phase 7 (Visual Prototyping)

Phase 7 follows this sequence when visual companion is available:

1. **Check availability**: `GET /status` to see if server is already running
2. **Start server if needed**: Spawn Node.js process, verify ready
3. **Open browser**: Playwright MCP or open command or log URL
4. **Generate mockup**: Create HTML/CSS from spec context and design decisions
5. **Push to server**: `POST /update` with mockup content
6. **Present for review**: ask_user_question in terminal (user views mockup in browser)
7. **Iterative refinement**: Revise mockup, re-POST, re-review (follows refinement loop pattern)
8. **Save approved mockup**: Write final HTML/CSS to `analysis/mockups/` in task directory

**When visual companion is unavailable**: Phase 7 falls back to the `ui-mockup-generator` agent for ASCII mockups. The iterative refinement loop still applies -- only the rendering medium changes.

### Mockup Generation Guidance

The orchestrator generates mockup HTML/CSS based on:
- Specification sections from Phase 6
- Design decisions from Phase 5 convergence
- Existing codebase UI patterns (from Phase 1 codebase analysis, if enhancement)
- Persona workflows from Phase 3 (if greenfield)

**Fidelity target**: Mid-fidelity. Enough structure and styling to evaluate layout, hierarchy, and flow. Not pixel-perfect production CSS. Focus on communicating the design intent, not building the final UI.

**What to generate** (user-facing wireframes/screens):
- Dashboard views, settings pages, list/detail screens
- Forms, modals, navigation bars, sidebars
- Data tables, cards, search/filter interfaces
- Empty states, error states, loading states
- Responsive layouts (desktop and mobile variations)

**What NOT to generate** (technical diagrams — these belong in analysis artifacts):
- System architecture diagrams
- Data flow charts, sequence diagrams
- Entity relationship diagrams
- Component dependency graphs

**Multiple screens**: Complex designs need multiple screens. The visual companion maintains a gallery — each `POST /update` adds a screen. Give each a descriptive title (e.g., "Patient Dashboard", "Settings - Notifications", "Error State - Network Failure"). The user can browse all screens via the gallery at `GET /`.

**Screen-to-screen navigation**: Add `data-screen="slug"` to interactive elements (links, buttons, cards) in mockup HTML. Clicking navigates to the target screen in the visual companion. The slug is the lowercase-hyphenated version of the screen title (e.g., "Settings Page" → `data-screen="settings-page"`). This creates an interactive prototype experience where the user can click through the flow.

---

## Server State & Persistence

The server maintains a screen gallery in memory and persists to disk:

- **Mockups array**: All POSTed screens (ordered, accessible by slug ID)
- **SSE clients**: Active EventSource connections for refresh notifications
- **Version counter**: Incremented on each update
- **Disk persistence**: Each POST automatically saves the rendered HTML to `{task_path}/analysis/mockups/{slug}.html` — pass `--task-path` when starting the server

**Routes**:
- `GET /` → Gallery index (grid of all screen cards)
- `GET /screen/{id}` → Individual screen with prev/next navigation
- `GET /latest` → Most recently POSTed screen (SSE refresh target)

Screens are saved to disk immediately on POST — if the session drops, mockups survive in `analysis/mockups/`.
