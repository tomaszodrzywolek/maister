# Research Orchestrator

Systematic research workflow from question definition to evidence-based documentation.

## Initialization

**BEFORE executing any phase, you MUST complete these steps:**

### Step 0: Session-reminder conflict resolution (decide ONCE)

Before doing anything else, settle this policy now and do not re-litigate it at any gate:

**`→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).` / `→ MANDATORY GATE` markers fire regardless of session-reminders, permission mode, or prior approval patterns.** Auto / acceptEdits / bypassPermissions modes, reminders saying "work without stopping" / "continue without asking" / "minimize clarifying questions," and compaction summaries showing the user approving every prior gate do NOT exempt you from invoking `ask_user_question` at a gate. They apply only to your discretionary clarifications.

If you find yourself reasoning "the user has been approving everything, so I can skip this gate" or "auto-mode is on, so I should minimize questions" — that reasoning IS the failure mode. STOP and fire the gate.

Full framework rule: `../orchestrator-framework/references/orchestrator-patterns.md` § 2 and § 2.1.

### Step 1: Load Framework Patterns

**Read the framework reference file NOW using the `read` tool:**

1. `../orchestrator-framework/references/orchestrator-patterns.md` - Delegation rules, interactive mode, state schema, initialization, context passing, issue resolution

### Step 2: Initialize Workflow

1. **Capture the clock**: run `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` via Bash NOW — you do NOT know the time from context. Every timestamp written this turn (`created`, `updated`, `generated`, `phases[].started`) uses this value. Date-only or `T00:00:00Z` values are the documented failure mode (orchestrator-patterns.md § 4 Timestamp Rule). Re-run `date` in later turns before writing timestamps.
2. **Create Task Items**: Use `todo({ action: "create", subject: "...", status: "pending" })` for all phases (see Phase Configuration), then set dependencies with `todo({ action: "update", id: <id>, addBlockedBy: [<dependency-id>] })`
3. **Create Task Directory**: `.maister/tasks/research/YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/`
4. **Initialize State**: Create `orchestrator-state.yml` with research context
5. **Set up Operator Dashboard** (orchestrator-patterns.md § 8) — first read `.maister/config.yml` and set `orchestrator.options.html_output` (default true if the file/key is absent). **When `html_output` is false, SKIP this entire step** — no `dashboard.html`, no `dashboard-data.js`, no browser auto-open — and proceed. Otherwise: copy `../orchestrator-framework/assets/dashboard.html` to the task root as `dashboard.html`, write the initial `dashboard-data.js` (all phases pending, `task.type: "research"`), then **auto-open it in the user's browser** (`open` / `xdg-open` / `start` per platform, passing the plain absolute filesystem path — NEVER a hand-built `file://` URL; on failure just print the path — never block). On resume: re-copy `dashboard.html` only if missing; regenerate `dashboard-data.js` from state; then auto-open it in the browser again (same opener as a new task — the OS focuses an already-open tab rather than duplicating).

**Output**:
```
🚀 Research Orchestrator Started

Task: [research question]
Directory: [task-path]
Dashboard: open [task-path]/dashboard.html in a browser to monitor progress

Starting Phase 1: Initialize research...
```

---

## Operator Visibility (applies to every phase)

> **Config gate**: these rules assume `options.html_output` is true (read from `.maister/config.yml` at init, default true). When **false**: skip the Dashboard-upkeep rule entirely (no dashboard files, no browser open, no rewrites) and the HTML-companions rule (do NOT pass `html_style_guide_path`; subagents write md only). The Artifact Summary Contract (§ 7 TL;DR blocks) and `phase_summaries` in state stay active either way.

Cross-cutting rules from `orchestrator-patterns.md` (same as the development orchestrator):

1. **Artifact Summary Contract (§ 7)**: every artifact-writing subagent prompt MUST include the contract instruction (artifacts open with TL;DR / Key Decisions / Open Questions & Risks). At context extraction, lift `decisions`, `risks`, and `artifacts` into `phase_summaries.[phase]` — verbatim, never re-summarized.
2. **Dashboard upkeep (§ 8)**: rewrite `dashboard-data.js` at every phase START (mark `in_progress` before delegating), **BEFORE firing every exit gate** (register the finished phase's artifacts/summary/decisions/risks — the operator reviews them on the dashboard while answering; status stays `in_progress` until the gate passes), after every phase completion (including skipped phases 3-5, with reason), every gate decision, and at finalization. **Phase 1 addition**: also refresh after each of its 4 steps completes, registering that step's artifacts — Phase 1 is long and the operator should see brief → plan → findings → report appear incrementally. In particular, after Step 4 the report (`outputs/research-report.md` + `.html`) MUST be registered before the Phase 1 exit gate fires.
3. **HTML companions (§ 9)**: pass `html_style_guide_path` (absolute path to `../orchestrator-framework/references/html-report-style.md`) to research-synthesizer, solution-brainstormer, and solution-designer. Register returned companion paths in `phase_summaries.[phase].artifacts[].html` so the dashboard hero cards link HTML first.
4. **icon_hint values** per phase: 1 `analysis`, 2 `plan`, 3 `spec`, 4 `plan`, 5 `spec`, 6 `done`.

## When to Use

Use when:
- Need comprehensive research on a topic
- Exploring codebase patterns or architecture
- Gathering requirements or best practices
- Want systematic evidence-based answers
- Research will feed into development workflows

**DO NOT use for**: Development tasks, bug fixes, performance optimization.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Evidence-Based**: Every finding must have source citation
2. **Systematic**: Follow structured methodology for consistent results
3. **Multi-Source**: Gather from codebase, docs, config, external sources
4. **Synthesized**: Cross-reference findings, identify patterns
5. **Actionable**: Produce outputs that enable next steps

---

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Research Foundation

**Purpose**: Initialize research, plan methodology, gather information from all sources, and synthesize findings into a research report
**Execute**: Multi-step: Direct + research-planner + information-gatherer (xN) + research-synthesizer
**Output**: `planning/research-brief.md`, `planning/research-plan.md`, `planning/sources.md`, `analysis/findings/*.md`, `analysis/synthesis.md`, `outputs/research-report.md`
**State**: Set `research_context.research_type`, `research_question`, `scope`, `methodology`, `sources`, `confidence_level`, `gathering_strategy`

This phase executes 4 sequential steps. On resume, check existing artifacts to skip completed steps.

#### Step 1: Initialize (Direct)

**Artifacts**: `planning/research-brief.md`
**Resume check**: If `planning/research-brief.md` exists, skip to Step 2

1. Parse research question (from command or prompt user)
2. Classify research type (auto-detect from keywords or use `--type` flag)
3. Determine scope (included, excluded, constraints)
4. Define success criteria
5. Create research brief
6. Update state: set `research_context.research_type`, `research_question`, `scope`
7. **Discover project documentation**: Read `.maister/docs/INDEX.md` (if exists), extract ALL file paths from the "Project Documentation" section — includes predefined docs AND any user-added project docs. Store as `research_context.project_doc_paths` in state.

#### Step 2: Plan (Subagent)

**Artifacts**: `planning/research-plan.md`, `planning/sources.md`
**Resume check**: If `planning/research-plan.md` AND `planning/sources.md` exist, skip to Step 3

**Read `references/research-methodologies.md` NOW using the `read` tool** — research type classification, methodology selection, gathering strategies

**INVOKE NOW**: Use subagent tool with subagent({ agent: "maister-research-planner", task: "..." })

**Context to pass**: task_path, research_brief_path, research_type, research_question, scope, project_doc_paths (from state)

Update state: `research_context.methodology`, `sources`

#### Step 3: Gather + Merge (Parallel Subagents + Direct)

**Artifacts**: `analysis/findings/*.md` (category-specific)
**Resume check**: If any `analysis/findings/*.md` files exist, skip to Step 4

**Determine gatherer count and categories**:
1. Read `planning/research-plan.md` for **Gathering Strategy** section
2. If gathering strategy found: use specified categories and count (cap at 8 max)
3. If no gathering strategy: fall back to default 4 categories (codebase, documentation, configuration, external)
4. Update state: `research_context.gathering_strategy`

**CRITICAL: Launch all N agents in ONE message for parallel execution.**

**Parallel Execution Pattern**:
```
Read gathering strategy from research-plan.md
For each category in strategy:
  Use subagent tool: source_category=[category_id] → analysis/findings/[prefix]-*.md
```

#### Step 4: Synthesize (Subagent)

**Artifacts**: `analysis/synthesis.md`, `outputs/research-report.md`
**Resume check**: If `analysis/synthesis.md` AND `outputs/research-report.md` exist, skip (Phase 1 complete)

**INVOKE NOW**: Use subagent tool with subagent({ agent: "maister-research-synthesizer", task: "..." })

**Context to pass**: task_path, findings_directory_path, research_question, research_type, methodology, html_style_guide_path (for the research-report.html companion)

**Synthesizer produces**:
- Pattern analysis and cross-references (`analysis/synthesis.md`)
- Comprehensive research report answering research question (`outputs/research-report.md`)
- Confidence levels for each finding
- Documented gaps and uncertainties

Update state: `research_context.confidence_level`

---

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - "Research foundation complete (initialized, planned, gathered, synthesized). Continue to brainstorming evaluation?"

---

### Phase 2: Optional Phases Decision

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 1 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", id: <id>, status: "..." })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Evaluate whether brainstorming and/or design phases would be valuable (independently)
**Execute**: Direct
**Output**: Updated `orchestrator-state.yml`
**State**: Set `options.brainstorming_enabled`, `options.design_enabled`

**Auto-resolve if**: `--brainstorm`/`--no-brainstorm` flags (brainstorming only), `--design`/`--no-design` flags (design only)

**Process**:
1. Read `analysis/synthesis.md` summary and `research_type` from state
2. Evaluate brainstorming value based on:
   - Number of viable approaches identified in synthesis (multiple → valuable)
   - Problem novelty (new domain → valuable; well-understood → less so)
   - Whether synthesis identified competing trade-offs (yes → valuable)
3. Evaluate design value based on:
   - Whether research suggests architectural decisions (yes → valuable)
   - Research type (requirements/mixed → likely valuable; technical → depends)
   - Whether design artifacts would feed into development workflow
4. If `brainstorming_enabled` not already set by flag, ask_user_question:
   - "[Brainstorming recommendation]. Would you like to explore solution alternatives?"
   - Options: "Yes, explore alternatives" / "No, skip brainstorming"
5. If `design_enabled` not already set by flag, ask_user_question:
   - "[Design recommendation]. Would you like to generate a high-level design?"
   - Options: "Yes, generate design" / "No, skip design"
6. Update state: set `brainstorming_enabled` and `design_enabled`

→ If brainstorming enabled: continue to Phase 3
→ If brainstorming disabled AND design enabled: skip to Phase 5
→ If both disabled: skip to Phase 6

---

### Phase 3: Solution Generation

**Purpose**: Generate solution alternatives from research evidence using specialized brainstormer subagent
**Execute**: solution-brainstormer subagent
**Output**: `outputs/solution-exploration.md`
**State**: Update `phase_summaries.phase-3`

**Skip if**: `brainstorming_enabled = false` (user chose to skip in Phase 2, or `--no-brainstorm` flag)

**Read `references/brainstorming-techniques.md` NOW using the `read` tool** — divergent/convergent thinking techniques, scope guardrails

> **ANTI-PATTERN**: Do NOT generate solution alternatives inline. The solution-brainstormer agent has specialized multi-perspective analysis capabilities.

**INVOKE NOW**: Use subagent tool with subagent({ agent: "maister-solution-brainstormer", task: "..." })

**Context to pass** (Pattern 7):
- `task_path`, `synthesis_path`, `research_report_path`
- `output_path`: `outputs/solution-exploration.md` — brainstormer MUST write to this exact path
- `html_style_guide_path` (for the solution-exploration.html companion)
- Accumulated context: `research_type`, `research_question`, `confidence_level`, `phase_summaries` (Phase 1)
- `project_doc_paths` (from state)

> **SELF-CHECK**: After subagent tool returns, verify `outputs/solution-exploration.md` exists and contains alternatives. If missing: **STOP. Do NOT proceed to Phase 4 or Phase 5.** Re-invoke the brainstormer with corrected context (ensure `output_path` is `outputs/solution-exploration.md`). If second attempt also fails, use ask_user_question to report the failure and ask whether to retry or skip brainstorming.

→ **AUTO-CONTINUE**

---

### Phase 4: Solution Convergence

**Purpose**: Present brainstorming alternatives to user for decision-making on each decision area
**Execute**: Direct (interactive)
**Output**: Updated `orchestrator-state.yml` with chosen approaches
**State**: Update `phase_summaries.phase-4` with `decision_areas` and `deferred_ideas`

**Skip if**: `brainstorming_enabled = false`
**Resume check**: If `phase_summaries.phase-4.decision_areas` has entries with `chosen_approach` set, skip already-resolved areas

> **ANTI-PATTERN**: Do NOT present all decision areas in a single summary table and ask one combined "do you agree?" question. Each area MUST get its own detailed presentation and its own ask_user_question call.
>
> **ANTI-PATTERN**: Do NOT show full alternatives/pros/cons for the first area and then shortcut remaining areas to just a recommendation line + question. EVERY area gets the SAME level of detail — all alternatives with descriptions, pros, and cons. No exceptions.
>
> **ANTI-PATTERN**: Do NOT batch multiple decision areas into one ask_user_question call. The tool accepts up to 4 questions per call — using that capacity here IS the documented failure mode. One call = one question = one decision area. The § 3 "group important decisions" guidance applies to subagent `decisions_needed` triage, NOT to convergence — convergence is strictly sequential.

1. Read `outputs/solution-exploration.md`
2. For each decision area **sequentially** — later areas may depend on earlier answers (a choice in area 1 can change which alternatives are even relevant in area 3), so do NOT pre-render or pre-ask later areas before the current one is answered. Output ALL of the following (steps a-d) BEFORE calling ask_user_question:
   a. **Area header**: area name and why this decision matters (1-2 sentences of context)
   b. **Alternatives detail**: For EVERY alternative in this area, show:
      - Name and description (2-3 sentences)
      - Pros (bullet list)
      - Cons (bullet list)
   c. **Recommendation**: which alternative is recommended and why (1 sentence)
   d. **ask_user_question (exactly ONE question in this call)**: this area's alternatives as options (mark recommended with "(Recommended)") + "Need more info" option
   e. If user picks → record choice, move to next area
   f. If "Need more info" → present the detailed trade-off analysis for the requested alternative, then re-ask

> **SELF-CHECK before each ask_user_question**: Did you output the alternatives with pros/cons for THIS area? If you only showed a recommendation line without listing all alternatives and their pros/cons, STOP and output the full detail before asking. Also: does this ask_user_question call contain exactly ONE question about exactly ONE area? If it has multiple questions, STOP and split.

3. After all areas resolved, present a brief summary of the chosen combination
4. Update state with chosen approaches per decision area

> **GATE CHECK**: Verify that ask_user_question was called for EACH decision area. If any decision area was skipped for any reason (e.g., output file missing, read failure), STOP and resolve before continuing. Do NOT mark Phase 4 complete without user convergence on all decision areas.

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - "Brainstorming complete. Continue to high-level design?"

---

### Phase 5: High-Level Design

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from the preceding phase in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", id: <id>, status: "..." })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Create architecture design from selected solution approach
**Execute**: Orchestrator-Direct Hybrid
**Output**: `outputs/high-level-design.md`, `outputs/decision-log.md`
**State**: Update `phase_summaries.phase-5`

**Skip if**: `design_enabled = false`

**Read `references/design-techniques.md` NOW using the `read` tool** — MADR format, ADR guidance, decision documentation patterns

**Part A — Design Direction (Direct)**:
1. If Phase 4 ran: confirm selected approaches from convergence
2. If Phase 4 was skipped: use research report recommendations as design input
3. ask_user_question for any design preferences or constraints (e.g., "Any architectural constraints or preferences?")

**Part B — Design Generation (Subagent)**:

> **ANTI-PATTERN**: Do NOT generate C4 architecture diagrams or ADRs inline. The solution-designer agent has specialized architecture and MADR documentation capabilities.

**INVOKE NOW**: Use subagent tool with subagent({ agent: "maister-solution-designer", task: "..." })

**Context to pass** (Pattern 7):
- `task_path`, `synthesis_path`, `research_report_path`
- `solution_exploration_path` (only if Phase 3-4 ran)
- `selected_approach` (from Phase 4 convergence if ran, or from research report recommendations)
- `design_preferences` (from Part A)
- `html_style_guide_path` (for the high-level-design.html + decision-log.html companions)
- Accumulated context: `research_type`, `research_question`, `confidence_level`, `phase_summaries`
- `project_doc_paths` (from state)

> **SELF-CHECK**: After subagent tool returns, verify both `outputs/high-level-design.md` and `outputs/decision-log.md` exist. If missing: **STOP. Do NOT proceed to Part C.** Re-invoke the designer with corrected context. If second attempt also fails, use ask_user_question to report the failure and ask whether to retry or skip design.

**Part C — Summary (Direct)**:
3. Read `outputs/high-level-design.md` and `outputs/decision-log.md`
4. Present executive summary to user:
   - Architecture style and key components
   - Number of architectural decisions recorded
   - Key decision highlights (1 line each)
   - Integration points with existing system (if applicable)

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - "Design complete. Continue to output generation?"

---

### Phase 6: Completion

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from the preceding phase in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", id: <id>, status: "..." })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Summarize research results and suggest next steps
**Execute**: Direct
**Output**: No new files — summarizes existing outputs

**Process**:
1. Inventory all generated outputs: `outputs/research-report.md` (always), plus conditional: `solution-exploration.md`, `high-level-design.md`, `decision-log.md`
2. Present executive summary to user:
   - Key findings and confidence level
   - Which optional phases ran (brainstorming, design)
   - Key decision highlights (if brainstorming/design ran)
3. If design artifacts exist, suggest starting development in a fresh session:
   ```
   To start development based on this research, clear context first or start a new session, then run:
   /maister-development [task-path]
   ```

→ End of workflow

## Integration with Other Workflows

### As Standalone Research

**Command**: `/maister-research [research-question]`
**Flow**: Complete all phases, save outputs in task directory

### As Embedded Research Phase

**Invoked by**: development orchestrator, migration orchestrator

**Integration**:
1. Parent orchestrator invokes research skill
2. Research executes phases 1-5 (skip Phase 6 completion — parent orchestrator handles next steps)
3. Design outputs fed into parent's specification phase
4. Research report saved in parent task's `analysis/research/` directory

**Handoff**:
```yaml
research_outputs:
  research_report: "[path to outputs/research-report.md]"
  findings_directory: "[path to analysis/findings/]"
  solution_exploration: "[path to outputs/solution-exploration.md]"
  high_level_design: "[path to outputs/high-level-design.md]"
  decision_log: "[path to outputs/decision-log.md]"
```

---

## Command Integration

Invoked via:
- `/maister-research [question] [--type=TYPE] [--brainstorm] [--no-brainstorm] [--design] [--no-design]` (new)
- `/maister-research [task-path] [--from=PHASE]` (resume)

**Brainstorming flags**:
- `--brainstorm`: Force brainstorming phase (auto-resolves Phase 2 brainstorming decision to "enable")
- `--no-brainstorm`: Skip brainstorming phase
- Neither: Phase 2 presents recommendation and asks user

**Design flags**:
