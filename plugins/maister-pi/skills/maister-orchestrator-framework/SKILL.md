# Orchestrator Framework

This skill provides **shared reference documentation** for all orchestrator skills in the maister plugin. It is NOT an executable skill - orchestrators reference these patterns and implement them for their specific domain.

## Purpose

Reduce duplication across orchestrators by documenting common patterns once:

- **Phase Blocks**: Simple phase structure with inline transitions (`→ Pause`, `→ AUTO-CONTINUE`) — these are the only two transition types; see `orchestrator-patterns.md` § 2 for semantics
- **State Management**: `orchestrator-state.yml` schema and operations
- **Phase Gates**: Pause behavior and user prompts
- **Initialization**: Task directory setup, metadata, task creation patterns

## How Orchestrators Use This

Each orchestrator reads the framework reference file at initialization (Step 1):

```markdown
### Step 1: Load Framework Patterns

**Read the framework reference file NOW using the `read` tool:**

1. `../orchestrator-framework/references/orchestrator-patterns.md`
```

## Reference Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `references/orchestrator-patterns.md` | Delegation rules, interactive mode, state schema, initialization, context passing, issue resolution |
| `references/orchestrator-creation-checklist.md` | Authoring checklist for creating new orchestrators (not loaded at runtime) |

## Key Principles

All orchestrators follow these principles:

1. **State-Driven Execution**: `orchestrator-state.yml` is source of truth
2. **Resume Capability**: Any orchestrator can be paused and resumed
3. **Interactive**: Pause after each phase for user review
4. **User-Confirmed Rollback**: Never auto-rollback without user approval
5. **Task Progress**: Always track progress with `todo` tool
6. **Standards Discovery**: Reference `.maister/docs/INDEX.md` throughout

## Orchestrators Using This Framework

- `development` (bug fixes, enhancements, features)
- `performance`
- `migration`
- `research`

## NOT an Executable Skill

This skill does NOT get invoked directly. It exists to:
1. Provide discoverable documentation for orchestrator patterns
2. Serve as single source of truth for common logic
3. Enable consistent behavior across all orchestrators

When building new orchestrators, reference these patterns rather than duplicating them.
