# Migration Orchestrator

Systematic migration workflow from current state analysis to verified migration with rollback capabilities.

## Initialization

**BEFORE executing any phase, you MUST complete these steps:**

### Step 0: Session-reminder conflict resolution (decide ONCE)

Before doing anything else, settle this policy now and do not re-litigate it at any gate:

**`→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).` / `→ MANDATORY GATE` markers fire regardless of session-reminders, permission mode, or prior approval patterns.** Auto / acceptEdits / bypassPermissions modes, reminders saying "work without stopping" / "continue without asking" / "minimize clarifying questions," and compaction summaries showing the user approving every prior gate do NOT exempt you from invoking `ask_user_question` at a gate. They apply only to your discretionary clarifications.

If you find yourself reasoning "the user has been approving everything, so I can skip this gate" or "auto-mode is on, so I should minimize questions" — that reasoning IS the failure mode. STOP and fire the gate.

Full framework rule: `../orchestrator-framework/references/orchestrator-patterns.md` § 2 and § 2.1.

### Step 1: Load Framework Patterns

**Read the framework reference file NOW using the `read` tool:**

1. `../orchestrator-framework/references/orchestrator-patterns.md` - Delegation rules, interactive mode, state schema, initialization, context passing, issue resolution

### Step 2: Initialize Workflow

1. **Capture the clock**: run `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` via Bash NOW — you do NOT know the time from context. Every timestamp written this turn (`created`, `updated`, `generated`, `phases[].started`) uses this value. Date-only or `T00:00:00Z` values are the documented failure mode (orchestrator-patterns.md § 4 Timestamp Rule). Re-run `date` in later turns before writing timestamps.
2. **Create Task Items**: Use `todo({ action: "create", ... })` for all phases (see Phase Configuration), then set dependencies with `todo({ action: "update", ... }) addBlockedBy`
3. **Create Task Directory**: `.maister/tasks/migrations/YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/`
4. **Initialize State**: Create `orchestrator-state.yml` with migration context
5. **Set up Operator Dashboard** (orchestrator-patterns.md § 8) — first read `.maister/config.yml` and set `orchestrator.options.html_output` (default true if the file/key is absent). **When `html_output` is false, SKIP this entire step** — no `dashboard.html`, no `dashboard-data.js`, no browser auto-open — and proceed. Otherwise: copy `../orchestrator-framework/assets/dashboard.html` to the task root as `dashboard.html`, write the initial `dashboard-data.js` (all phases pending, `task.type: "migration"`), then **auto-open it in the user's browser** (`open` / `xdg-open` / `start` per platform, passing the plain absolute filesystem path — NEVER a hand-built `file://` URL; on failure just print the path — never block). On resume: re-copy `dashboard.html` only if missing; regenerate `dashboard-data.js` from state; then auto-open it in the browser again (same opener as a new task — the OS focuses an already-open tab rather than duplicating).
6. **Discover project documentation**: Read `.maister/docs/INDEX.md` (if exists), extract ALL file paths from the "Project Documentation" section — includes predefined docs AND any user-added project docs. Store as `project_context.project_doc_paths` in state.

**Output**:
```
🚀 Migration Orchestrator Started

Task: [migration description]
Directory: [task-path]
Dashboard: open [task-path]/dashboard.html in a browser to monitor progress

Starting Phase 1: Analyze current state...
```

---

## Operator Visibility (applies to every phase)

> **Config gate**: these rules assume `options.html_output` is true (read from `.maister/config.yml` at init, default true). When **false**: skip the Dashboard-upkeep rule entirely (no dashboard files, no browser open, no rewrites) and the HTML-companions rule (do NOT pass `html_style_guide_path`; subagents write md only). The Artifact Summary Contract (§ 7 TL;DR blocks) and `phase_summaries` in state stay active either way.

Cross-cutting rules from `orchestrator-patterns.md` (same as the development orchestrator):

1. **Artifact Summary Contract (§ 7)**: every artifact-writing subagent prompt MUST include the contract instruction (artifacts open with TL;DR / Key Decisions / Open Questions & Risks). At context extraction, lift `decisions`, `risks`, and `artifacts` into `phase_summaries.[phase]` — verbatim, never re-summarized.
2. **Dashboard upkeep (§ 8)**: rewrite `dashboard-data.js` at every phase START (mark `in_progress` before delegating), **BEFORE firing every exit gate** (register the finished phase's artifacts/summary/decisions/risks — the operator reviews them on the dashboard while answering; status stays `in_progress` until the gate passes), after every phase completion (including skipped phases, with reason), every gate decision, every verification cycle, and at finalization. Every rewrite starts with `date -u` (one call per turn). It is a terse projection of state — never duplicate artifact content into it.
3. **HTML companions (§ 9)**: pass `html_style_guide_path` (absolute path to `../orchestrator-framework/references/html-report-style.md`) to specification-creator, implementation-planner, and implementation-verifier. Register returned `html_path` values in `phase_summaries.[phase].artifacts[].html` so the dashboard hero cards link HTML first.
4. **icon_hint values** per phase: 1 `analysis`, 2 `analysis`, 3 `spec`, 4 `plan`, 5 `code`, 6 `verify`, 7 `verify`, 8 `docs`.

## When to Use

Use for:
- Migrating from one framework/library to another (e.g., Vue 2 → Vue 3, Express → Fastify)
- Changing database platforms (e.g., MySQL → PostgreSQL, MongoDB → DynamoDB)
- Refactoring architecture patterns (e.g., REST → GraphQL, Monolith → Microservices)
- Upgrading major versions with breaking changes

**DO NOT use for**: New features, bug fixes, pure refactoring without technology change.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Analyze Before Migrating**: Understand current system before planning target state
2. **Risk Assessment**: Classify migration type (code/data/architecture) and assess complexity
3. **Incremental Execution**: Support phased migration with rollback points
4. **Rollback Planning**: Document undo procedures for each migration phase
5. **Dual-Run Support**: Enable running old and new systems in parallel during transition

---

## Migration Types

| Type | Keywords | Strategy | Risk Focus |
|------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Code** | framework, library, upgrade | Incremental or phased | Breaking changes, API differences |
| **Data** | database, schema, data migration | Dual-run (zero downtime) | Data integrity, checksums |
| **Architecture** | REST→GraphQL, monolith→microservices | Dual-run or phased | Compatibility, rollback |

---

## Phase Configuration

| Phase | content | activeForm | Agent/Skill |

| 1 | "Analyze current state" | "Analyzing current state" | codebase-analyzer |
| 2 | "Plan target state and gaps" | "Planning target state and gaps" | gap-analyzer |
| 3 | "Gather requirements & create migration strategy" | "Gathering requirements & creating migration strategy" | Direct + specification-creator (subagent) |
| 4 | "Plan implementation" | "Planning implementation" | implementation-planner (subagent) |
| 5 | "Execute migration" | "Executing migration" | implementation-plan-executor |
| 6 | "Verify and test compatibility" | "Verifying and testing compatibility" | implementation-verifier |
| 7 | "Resolve verification issues" | "Resolving verification issues" | Direct (conditional) |
| 8 | "Generate documentation" | "Generating documentation" | user-docs-generator (optional) |

---

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis & Clarifications

**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis of current system before migration, followed by scope/requirements clarification
**Execute**:
1. inline skill `maister-codebase-analyzer`
2. Update state with analysis results
3. Direct - use ask_user_question for max 5 critical clarifying questions about migration scope, target system, and constraints
4. Save clarifications to `analysis/clarifications.md`
**Output**: `analysis/current-state-analysis.md`, `analysis/clarifications.md`
**State**: Update task_context with current system info, `task_context.clarifications_resolved`

→ **AUTO-CONTINUE** — Do NOT end turn, do NOT prompt user. Proceed immediately to Phase 2.

---

### Phase 2: Target State Planning & Gap Analysis

**Purpose**: Define target system and identify migration gaps
**Execute**: subagent tool - `maister-gap-analyzer` subagent
**Output**: `analysis/target-state-plan.md`
**State**: Update `migration_context.migration_type`, `target_system`, `risk_level`, `breaking_changes`

**Gap Analyzer Tasks**:
1. Define target system from migration description
2. Identify gaps (features to migrate, APIs to adapt, data to transform)
3. Classify migration type (code/data/architecture)
4. Recommend migration strategy (incremental/big-bang/dual-run/phased)
5. External research via `web_search` for version upgrades

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - Display executive summary before asking. Extract from gap analysis: current system overview, target system, migration type classified, number of gaps identified, recommended strategy, risk level. Format as brief overview then "Continue to migration strategy?"

---

### Phase 3: Migration Requirements & Strategy Specification

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 2 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Gather migration requirements, then create detailed migration specification with rollback procedures
**Execute**:

**Part A — Migration Requirements Gathering (inline)**:
1. Direct - use ask_user_question for migration-specific requirements (3-5 questions):
   - Migration scope and boundaries (what's in/out of migration)
   - Rollback expectations and downtime tolerance
   - Data migration specifics (if data migration type)
   - Dual-run requirements (if applicable)
   - Existing code/config to preserve
   - Frame as confirmable assumptions: "I assume X, is that correct?"
2. Save gathered requirements to `analysis/requirements.md`

**Part B — Specification Creation (subagent)**:
3. subagent tool - `maister-specification-creator` subagent

**Context to pass to subagent**: task_path, task_type (migration), task_description, requirements_path (analysis/requirements.md), project_context_paths (INDEX.md + project_doc_paths from state — all discovered project docs), migration_type, current_system, target_system, risk_level, breaking_changes, phase_summaries (current_state_analysis, gap_analysis), html_style_guide_path (for the spec.html companion)

**Output**: `analysis/requirements.md`, `implementation/spec.md`, `analysis/rollback-plan.md`, optionally `analysis/dual-run-plan.md`
**State**: Update `rollback_plan_created`, `dual_run_configured`

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - Display executive summary before asking. Read `implementation/spec.md` and extract: migration strategy chosen, scope boundaries, rollback approach, breaking changes identified, key constraints. Format as brief overview then "Continue to implementation planning?"

---

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 3 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Break migration into task groups with rollback steps
**Execute**: subagent tool - `maister-implementation-planner` subagent
**Output**: `implementation/implementation-plan.md` with rollback procedures
**State**: Update task groups and dependencies

**Context to pass to subagent**: task_path, task_type (migration), migration_type, task_description, phase_summaries (current_state_analysis, gap_analysis, specification), html_style_guide_path (for the implementation-plan.html companion)

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - Display executive summary before asking. Read `implementation/implementation-plan.md` and extract: number of task groups, total steps, rollback steps included, key dependencies, execution sequence. Format as brief overview then "Continue to execute migration?"

---

### Phase 5: Migration Execution

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 4 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Execute migration steps with incremental verification

**ANTI-PATTERN — DO NOT DO THIS:**
- ❌ "Let me implement this directly..." — STOP. Delegate to implementation-plan-executor.
- ❌ "This migration is simple enough to code inline..." — STOP. Simplicity is NOT a reason to skip delegation.

**INVOKE NOW** — inline skill execution:

**Execute**: inline skill `maister-implementation-plan-executor`
**Output**: Implemented migration changes, `implementation/work-log.md`
**State**: Update implementation progress, extract phase_summaries.implementation

📋 **Standards Reminder**: Review `.maister/docs/INDEX.md` before implementing.

**SELF-CHECK**: Did you just invoke the inline skill `maister-implementation-plan-executor`? Or did you start writing migration code yourself? If the latter, STOP immediately and invoke the inline skill loading instead.

**⚠️ POST-IMPLEMENTATION CONTINUATION** — After the skill completes and returns control:
1. **HTML plan reconciliation** (backstop for syncs missed during waves): if `implementation/implementation-plan.html` exists, for every group whose md checkboxes are all `[x]`, run the executor's idempotent marker-flip command (`sed` flipping `data-step="N\.[0-9]*" class="step todo"` and `data-group="N" class="group todo"` to `done`). VERIFY: when all md steps are checked, `grep -c 'class="step todo"' implementation/implementation-plan.html` must return 0.
2. Read `orchestrator-state.yml` to confirm you are the orchestrator
3. Update state: add Phase 5 to `completed_phases`
4. Proceed to Phase 6

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - Display executive summary before asking. Extract from `phase_summaries.implementation` and `implementation/work-log.md`: migration steps completed, files changed, test results, rollback readiness status. Format as brief overview then "Continue to verification?"

---

### Phase 6: Verification + Compatibility Testing

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 5 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Verify migration success with compatibility and rollback testing
**Execute**: inline skill `maister-implementation-verifier`
**Output**: `verification/implementation-verification.md`, `verification/compatibility-test-results.md`
**State**: Update verification results

**Migration-Specific Checks**:
- Verify old system still works (if dual-run)
- Test rollback procedures (non-destructive)
- Validate data integrity (for data migrations)
- Check performance benchmarks (before/after)

**⚠️ POST-VERIFICATION CONTINUATION** — After the skill completes and returns control:
1. Read `orchestrator-state.yml` to confirm you are the orchestrator
2. Update state: add Phase 6 to `completed_phases`
3. Evaluate verdict: if PASS → Phase 8, if fixable issues → Phase 7, otherwise stop workflow

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - Display executive summary before asking. Extract from verification results: overall verdict, issue counts by severity, compatibility test results, data integrity status, rollback test results. Format as detailed overview then "Continue to Phase [7 or 8]?"

---

### Phase 7: Migration Issue Resolution (Conditional)

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 6 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Fix verification issues through direct editing and re-verification
**Execute**: Direct - apply fixes, re-verify
**Output**: Updated code, `verification_context.fixes_applied`
**State**: Update `reverify_count`, `decisions_made`

**Skip if**: verdict = PASS

**Process**:
1. Display detailed issue breakdown grouped by category and severity, listing location, description, and fixability
2. Present all critical + warning issues as a numbered list
3. ask_user_question — "Which issues should I fix?" with options: "Fix all fixable issues" / "Let me choose specific issues" / "Skip fixes, proceed as-is"
4. Fix selected issues
5. ask_user_question — "Re-run verification to check fixes?" with options: "Yes, re-run verification" / "No, proceed to next phase"
6. If re-run → re-invoke `maister-implementation-verifier` → return to Step 1
7. Max 3 iterations

**Data Safety Critical**: HALT on any data integrity issue - never auto-fix data problems. Always present data issues to user with rollback option.

**Exit Conditions**:
- ✅ No critical issues remain → Proceed to Phase 8
- ⚠️ Max iterations (3) reached → Ask user: proceed with warnings or rollback
- ❌ Data integrity issues → HALT immediately, recommend rollback

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - Display executive summary: total issues found, issues fixed, issues remaining by severity. Then "Continue to documentation?"

---

### Phase 8: Documentation (Optional)

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from the preceding phase in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Create migration guide for end users
**Execute**: subagent tool - `maister-user-docs-generator` subagent
**Output**: `documentation/migration-guide.md`
**State**: Set documentation complete

**Skip if**: `options.docs_enabled = false`

**Documentation Covers**:
- Migration overview and goals
- Prerequisites and preparation steps
- Step-by-step migration procedure
- Rollback procedures
- Troubleshooting common issues

→ End of workflow
