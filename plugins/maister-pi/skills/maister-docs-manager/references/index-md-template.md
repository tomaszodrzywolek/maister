# INDEX.md Template

Use this structure when generating or updating `.maister/docs/INDEX.md`. Scan the actual `.maister/docs/` directory to populate sections dynamically — do not hardcode file lists.

For technical standards, the description MUST enumerate specific practices/conventions documented in the file, not just a generic category description.

```markdown
# Documentation Index

## How to Use This Documentation

1. **Start Here**: Always read this INDEX.md first to understand what documentation exists
2. **Project Context**: Read relevant project documentation before starting work
3. **Standards**: This index only points to the standards — open and follow the specific standard files relevant to your task; don't rely on the index alone
4. **Keep Updated**: Update documentation when making significant changes
5. **Customize**: Adapt all documentation to your project's specific needs

## Updating Documentation

- Project documentation should be updated when goals, tech stack, or architecture changes
- Technical standards should be updated when team conventions evolve
- Always update INDEX.md when adding, removing, or significantly changing documentation
```
