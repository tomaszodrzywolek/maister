## Source Identification Patterns

### Codebase Sources

**File Pattern Generation**:
1. Extract key terms from research question (nouns, technical terms)
2. Generate patterns:
   ```
   **/*{term}*.{js,ts,py,java,go,rb,php}
   **/services/{term}*
   **/controllers/{term}*
   **/middleware/{term}*
   **/models/{term}*
   **/utils/{term}*
   ```

3. Search by concept:
   ```
   Authentication → **/*auth*, **/security/*, **/session/*
   Database → **/*db*, **/*database*, **/*models*, **/*repository*
   API → **/*api*, **/*routes*, **/*controllers*, **/*endpoints*
   ```

**Directory Structure Analysis**:
- List directories to understand organization
- Identify module boundaries
- Map feature areas

**Test Files**:
- Tests provide usage examples and expected behavior
- Pattern: `**/*test*, **/*spec*, tests/**, __tests__/**`

**Configuration**:
- Configuration reveals setup and dependencies
- Files: `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `requirements.txt`, `Gemfile`, `go.mod`
- Config directories: `config/`, `.config/`, `conf/`

---

---

## Information Gathering Strategies

### Iterative Deepening Strategy

**Phase 1: Broad Discovery** (fast, high-level)
- Use `find` to find all potentially relevant files
- Quick scan of directory structure
- Identify major areas

**Phase 2: Targeted Reading** (moderate depth)
- Read key files completely
- Extract main components and patterns
- Identify integration points

**Phase 3: Deep Dive** (detailed analysis)
- Trace specific flows
- Understand implementation details
- Map dependencies

**Phase 4: Verification** (validation)
- Cross-reference findings
- Validate understanding with tests
- Identify gaps

**Adaptation**: Skip or combine phases based on research complexity

---

### Multi-Source Triangulation Strategy

**Purpose**: Validate findings through multiple independent sources

**Approach**:
1. Gather information from source type A (e.g., code)
2. Gather information from source type B (e.g., docs)
3. Gather information from source type C (e.g., tests)
4. Compare findings across sources
5. High confidence: Sources agree
6. Medium confidence: Some agreement
7. Low confidence: Sources disagree or single source only

**Example**:
- **Code** says authentication uses JWT
- **Configuration** shows jwt library in dependencies
- **Tests** validate JWT token generation
- **Conclusion**: High confidence - JWT authentication confirmed by 3 sources

---

### Progressive Refinement Strategy

**Purpose**: Start broad, progressively narrow focus

**Approach**:
1. **Start Broad**: Search entire codebase for relevant terms
2. **Initial Filtering**: Identify most relevant directories/files
3. **Focused Investigation**: Deep dive into filtered set
4. **Targeted Expansion**: Expand to related areas as needed
5. **Final Verification**: Confirm understanding is complete

**Example**:
1. Search for "payment" across entire codebase → 150 files
2. Filter to payment module → 30 files
3. Read core payment service files → 5 files
4. Expand to payment gateway integration → 8 more files
5. Verify with payment tests → 10 test files

## Analysis Frameworks

### Technical Research Analysis Framework

**Component Inventory**:
- List all components/modules/classes
- Categorize by responsibility (service, controller, model, util)
- Map directory structure to logical architecture

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Identify design patterns (singleton, factory, strategy, etc.)
- Recognize architectural patterns (MVC, layered, microservices)
- Document consistency of pattern application

**Flow Analysis**:
- Trace request/response flows
- Map data transformations
- Document control flow (decision points, loops)
- Identify error handling flows

**Integration Mapping**:
- Internal dependencies (module A depends on module B)
- External dependencies (third-party libraries, external APIs)
- Database interactions
- Infrastructure dependencies

**Quality Assessment**:
- Code quality (duplication, complexity, readability)
- Test coverage (what's tested, what's not)
- Documentation quality (comprehensive, missing, outdated)
- Consistency (naming, structure, patterns)

---

### Requirements Research Analysis Framework

**Requirement Extraction**:
- Explicit requirements (stated directly)
- Implicit requirements (inferred from context)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)

**Categorization**:
- By feature area (reporting, authentication, data management)
- By stakeholder (admin, user, developer, operations)
- By priority (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have)
- By type (functional, non-functional, constraint)

**Gap Analysis**:
- Missing requirements (not specified)
- Ambiguous requirements (unclear)
- Conflicting requirements (contradictory)
- Incomplete requirements (missing details)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Testable conditions for requirement completion
- Success metrics
- User validation approach

---

### Literature Research Analysis Framework

**Source Evaluation**:
- Authority (official docs, recognized experts)
- Currency (up-to-date vs outdated)
- Relevance (applicable to project context)
- Completeness (comprehensive vs superficial)

**Approach Comparison**:
- Approach A: Description, pros, cons, use cases
- Approach B: Description, pros, cons, use cases
- Trade-offs: When to use which

**Applicability Assessment**:
- Technical fit (compatible with tech stack)
- Constraint fit (works within limitations)
- Resource fit (feasible with available resources)
- Risk assessment (implementation risks)

**Recommendation Synthesis**:
- What to adopt (and why)
- What to adapt (and how)
- What to avoid (and why)

---

## Research Execution Patterns

### Serial Execution Pattern

**When**: Phases depend on each other

**Flow**:
1. Complete Phase 1 fully
2. Use Phase 1 outputs for Phase 2
3. Complete Phase 2 fully
4. Continue sequentially

**Example**: Discovery → Reading → Deep Dive → Synthesis

---

### Parallel Execution Pattern

**When**: Independent sub-questions can be investigated simultaneously

**Flow**:
1. Decompose research question into independent sub-questions
2. Investigate each sub-question in parallel
3. Synthesize findings together

**Example**:
- Sub-question A: "How is authentication implemented?" (codebase)
- Sub-question B: "What are authentication best practices?" (literature)
- Both investigated independently, then synthesized

---

### Spiral Pattern

**When**: Understanding develops iteratively through repeated cycles

**Flow**:
1. Cycle 1: Surface-level understanding across all areas
2. Cycle 2: Moderate depth across all areas (informed by Cycle 1)
3. Cycle 3: Deep understanding in key areas (informed by Cycle 2)

**Example**:
- Cycle 1: Find all auth-related files (broad discovery)
- Cycle 2: Read main auth files (targeted reading)
- Cycle 3: Trace auth flow end-to-end (deep dive)

---

## Confidence Scoring Patterns

### High Confidence (90-100%)

**Indicators**:
- Multiple independent sources confirm
- Direct evidence (code, explicit docs)
- No contradictions found
- Verified through tests or usage examples

**Example**: "Authentication uses Passport.js with JWT strategy"
- Evidence: Code imports, configuration, tests, documentation all confirm

---

### Medium Confidence (60-89%)

**Indicators**:
- Single source or indirect evidence
- Inferred from patterns or context
- Minor contradictions or gaps
- Partial verification

**Example**: "Token refresh might be handled by client"
- Evidence: Server doesn't have refresh endpoint, but client code unclear

---

### Low Confidence (<60%)

**Indicators**:
- Speculation or assumption
- Contradictory evidence
- No direct confirmation
- Significant gaps in understanding

**Example**: "OAuth integration appears incomplete"
- Evidence: OAuth packages installed but no routes configured (ambiguous intent)

---

## Adaptation Strategies

### Adjust Scope Based on Findings

**Expand Scope**:
- If initial findings reveal related areas that must be understood
- If dependencies require understanding of additional components

**Narrow Scope**:
- If research question can be answered with subset of sources
- If areas are well-documented and don't need deep investigation

---

### Adjust Depth Based on Complexity

**Increase Depth**:
- If implementations are complex or non-standard
- If documentation is missing or incomplete
- If contradictions need resolution

**Decrease Depth**:
- If implementations are standard and well-documented
- If patterns are consistent and clear
- If multiple sources confirm understanding

---

### Adjust Timeline Based on Findings

**Extend Timeline**:
- Significant gaps in documentation
- Complex implementations requiring deep analysis
- Multiple contradictions to resolve

**Shorten Timeline**:
- Excellent documentation available
- Standard implementations
- High confidence early findings

---

## Common Pitfalls and Mitigations

### Pitfall: Scope Creep

**Problem**: Research expands beyond original question
**Mitigation**: Continuously refer back to research question; document scope expansions explicitly

---

### Pitfall: Insufficient Evidence

**Problem**: Making claims without adequate proof
**Mitigation**: Maintain strict citation discipline; mark low-confidence findings

---

### Pitfall: Missing Integration Points

**Problem**: Understanding components in isolation without seeing how they connect
**Mitigation**: Explicitly include integration mapping phase

---

### Pitfall: Outdated Information

**Problem**: Relying on old documentation or examples
**Mitigation**: Check file timestamps; prioritize recently modified files; verify docs match code

---

### Pitfall: Over-Confidence

**Problem**: Stating findings with more confidence than evidence warrants
**Mitigation**: Use confidence scoring; acknowledge limitations; document uncertainties
