# Bottleneck Analyzer

Identifies performance bottlenecks through static code analysis and optional user-provided profiling data.

## Purpose

Detect performance anti-patterns by reading code, not running tools:
- N+1 query patterns in ORM usage
- Missing database indexes (from schema + query patterns)
- O(n^2) and worse algorithmic complexity
- Blocking I/O operations
- Memory leak patterns (unbounded caches, event listener leaks)
- Missing caching opportunities
- Sequential operations that could be parallelized

**Philosophy**: Focus on patterns the agent CAN reliably detect by reading code. Provide conservative impact estimates (ranges, not false precision). Every finding must include file:line evidence.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Ingest Context**: Read codebase analysis + optional user profiling data
2. **Analyze Database Patterns**: Detect N+1, missing indexes, slow query patterns
3. **Analyze Code Patterns**: Detect algorithmic inefficiencies, blocking I/O
4. **Detect Memory Patterns**: Find leak-prone patterns and excessive allocations
5. **Identify I/O & Concurrency Issues**: Locate blocking operations, parallelization opportunities
6. **Identify Caching Opportunities**: Find repeated expensive operations
7. **Classify & Prioritize**: Score by estimated impact vs effort
8. **Generate Analysis Report**: Comprehensive bottleneck report with file:line references

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Ingest Context

**Purpose**: Load codebase analysis and any user-provided profiling data

**Actions**:
1. Read `analysis/codebase-analysis.md` (from codebase-analyzer, required)
2. Check for `analysis/user-profiling-data/` directory
3. If user data exists:
   - Read all files (text logs, screenshots via `read` tool, CSV exports)
   - Extract actionable insights (slow endpoints, hot functions, query counts)
   - Note which findings came from user data vs static analysis
4. Identify key files for deep analysis based on codebase report:
   - Database models, repositories, DAOs
   - Controllers, route handlers, API endpoints
   - Service layer and business logic
   - Schema definitions and migration files
   - Configuration files (connection pools, cache config)

**Output**: Context loaded, target files identified for analysis

### Phase 2: Analyze Database Patterns

**Purpose**: Detect database performance anti-patterns from code

**N+1 Query Detection** (static - read code, don't run queries):

Detect ORM calls inside iteration constructs:
- Loop + query pattern: `for`/`forEach`/`map` containing `.find`, `.findOne`, `.findByPk`, `.get`, `.query`
- Framework-specific patterns:
  - **Sequelize**: `Model.findByPk()` or `Model.findOne()` inside loop
  - **Prisma**: `prisma.[model].findUnique()` inside iteration
  - **TypeORM**: `repository.findOne()` or `getRepository().find()` in loops
  - **Django**: Attribute access on queryset (lazy loading) inside template/view loops
  - **Rails**: Association method calls without `.includes()` or `.preload()`
  - **SQLAlchemy**: Relationship access without `joinedload()` or `subqueryload()`

**Missing Index Detection** (read schema/migrations, don't run EXPLAIN):
- Read migration files and schema definitions to catalog existing indexes
- Use `grep` for query patterns (WHERE, ORDER BY, JOIN columns)
- Cross-reference: columns filtered/sorted on without corresponding indexes
- Flag composite conditions without composite indexes

**Slow Query Patterns** (anti-patterns detectable from code):
- `SELECT *` when only a few columns are needed
- Missing `LIMIT` on queries against large tables
- String operations in WHERE clauses (`LIKE '%...'`)
- Subqueries that could be JOINs
- Unbounded queries without pagination

**Output**: List of database bottlenecks with file:line references and fix approach

---

### Phase 3: Analyze Code Patterns

**Purpose**: Detect algorithmic and computational inefficiencies

**O(n^2) and Nested Loop Detection**:
- Nested loops over same or related data structures
- `Array.find()`/`filter()`/`includes()` inside loops (linear search in loop = O(n^2))
- `indexOf` inside loops (should use Set/Map)
- Sorting inside loops
- Repeated list scanning instead of pre-building lookup index

**Repeated Computation Detection**:
- Same function called multiple times with same arguments (no memoization)
- `new RegExp()` or regex literal compilation inside loops
- `JSON.parse()`/`JSON.stringify()` in hot code paths
- Date parsing or formatting repeated in loops

**Inefficient Data Structure Usage**:
- Array for lookups (should be Map/Set for O(1) access)
- `Object.keys().find()` instead of direct property access
- Repeated array scanning instead of pre-building index/map
- String concatenation in loops (should use array join or buffer)

**Output**: Code pattern bottlenecks with complexity analysis and estimated improvement

---

### Phase 4: Detect Memory Patterns

**Purpose**: Identify memory leak risks and excessive allocation patterns

**Static Detection** (patterns in code, not heap snapshots):
- **Unbounded caches**: `Map` or `Object` in module/class scope that grows without eviction policy (no `.delete()`, no size limit, no TTL)
- **Event listener leaks**: `addEventListener`/`on()` without corresponding `removeEventListener`/`off()` in cleanup/destroy
- **Closure leaks**: Closures holding references to large objects in long-lived scopes
- **Timer leaks**: `setInterval`/`setTimeout` without `clearInterval`/`clearTimeout` in cleanup
- **Large allocations in hot paths**: Creating large arrays/buffers/objects inside frequently-called functions
- **Global mutable state**: Module-level collections that accumulate data across requests

**Severity Assessment**:
- **High**: Unbounded caches in server-side code, event listener leaks in long-running processes
- **Medium**: Timer leaks, closure references to large objects
- **Low**: Large allocations in infrequent code paths

**Output**: Memory risk patterns with severity and remediation approach

---

### Phase 5: Identify I/O & Concurrency Issues

**Purpose**: Find blocking operations and parallelization opportunities

**Blocking I/O Detection**:
- Synchronous file operations: `readFileSync`, `writeFileSync`, `readdirSync`, `existsSync` in request handlers
- Synchronous process execution: `execSync`, `spawnSync` in hot paths
- Synchronous crypto/compression in request handlers

**Sequential Operations That Could Be Parallel**:
- Multiple sequential `await` calls on independent operations (should be `Promise.all()`)
- Sequential HTTP requests to different services
- Sequential database queries that don't depend on each other

**Connection Management Issues**:
- Creating new database connections per request instead of using connection pool
- Missing timeouts on HTTP/database calls
- No retry logic on external service calls
- Connection pool configuration issues (too small, no max)

**Output**: I/O bottlenecks with fix approach and estimated concurrency improvement

---

### Phase 6: Identify Caching Opportunities

**Purpose**: Find expensive repeated operations that should be cached

**Detection Strategies**:
- Same database query called multiple times per request or across requests with same parameters
- Expensive computation with deterministic inputs (no side effects, same input = same output)
- External API calls returning slowly-changing data (configuration, feature flags, reference data)
- Template/view rendering without caching for static or rarely-changing content
- Configuration/settings loading on every request instead of at startup

**Assessment Criteria**:
- How expensive is the operation? (DB query, API call, CPU computation)
- How frequently is it called? (per request, per page, per session)
- How often does the result change? (determines appropriate TTL)
- What's the cache invalidation strategy? (TTL, event-based, manual)

**Output**: Caching opportunities with TTL recommendations and implementation approach

---

### Phase 7: Classify & Prioritize

**Purpose**: Score each bottleneck using impact/effort framework for data-driven prioritization

**Impact Scoring (1-10)**:

Factors:
- **Performance improvement potential**: Estimated improvement range
- **Frequency**: How often this code path executes
- **User visibility**: Direct user-facing vs background job
- **Cascading effects**: Does it block other operations

Scoring guidelines:
- 9-10: High-frequency, user-facing, large improvement potential (e.g., N+1 on listing page)
- 7-8: High frequency or large improvement (e.g., missing index on common query)
- 5-6: Medium frequency and improvement (e.g., algorithm optimization)
- 3-4: Low frequency or small improvement (e.g., background job optimization)
- 1-2: Minimal improvement or rare execution

**Effort Scoring (1-10)**:

Factors:
- **Code changes**: Lines changed, number of files affected
- **Testing complexity**: Easy to verify vs extensive test coverage needed
- **Risk level**: Safe change vs potential for regressions
- **Dependencies**: Standalone vs affects many components

Scoring guidelines:
- 1-2: Single line change, low risk (e.g., add database index, add `.includes()`)
- 3-4: Small code change, standard testing (e.g., fix N+1 with eager loading)
- 5-6: Moderate refactoring, thorough testing needed (e.g., algorithm optimization)
- 7-8: Significant changes, extensive testing (e.g., add caching layer)
- 9-10: Major refactoring, high risk (e.g., architecture change)

**Priority Calculation**:
```
Priority = Impact / Effort

P0 (Critical): Priority >3.0 - Quick wins with high impact
P1 (High):     Priority 1.5-3.0 - High value optimizations
P2 (Medium):   Priority 0.8-1.5 - Moderate value optimizations
P3 (Low):      Priority <0.8 - Nice-to-have improvements
```

**Important**: For static analysis, impact estimates use CONSERVATIVE RANGES:
- "Likely 50-80% query reduction" not "exactly 73% improvement"
- "O(n^2) to O(n) on collections typically containing ~1000 items"
- "Eliminates ~N redundant queries per request where N = result set size"

**Output**: Scored bottleneck list with calculated priorities

- **`grep`**: Search for patterns (ORM calls in loops, sync I/O, regex compilation, unbounded caches)
- **`find`**: Find related files (models, controllers, services, configs, migrations, schema files)

**NOT used**: Bash (no runtime profiling, no command execution)

## Success Criteria

Bottleneck analysis is complete when:

- Codebase analysis ingested and key files identified
- Database patterns analyzed (N+1, missing indexes, slow query patterns)
- Code patterns analyzed (algorithmic complexity, repeated computation)
- Memory patterns checked (leak risks, excessive allocations)
- I/O patterns analyzed (blocking ops, parallelization opportunities)
- Caching opportunities identified
- All bottlenecks scored with impact/effort and prioritized (P0-P3)
- Comprehensive analysis report generated with file:line references
- Limitations section documents what static analysis cannot detect

---

## Key Principles

- **Static First**: Base all findings on code patterns, not runtime data
- **Evidence-Based**: Every bottleneck includes file:line reference and pattern evidence
- **Conservative Estimates**: Provide ranges, not false precision
- **User Data Bonus**: When user provides profiling data, correlate with static findings for higher confidence
- **Actionable Output**: Each bottleneck has enough context for the specification-creator to write a spec
- **Honest Limitations**: Clearly state what static analysis cannot detect and recommend runtime tools
