# Performance Orchestrator

Static-analysis-first performance optimization workflow. Identifies bottlenecks by reading code, then uses the standard specification/planning/implementation/verification pipeline to fix them.

## Initialization

**BEFORE executing any phase, you MUST complete these steps:**

### Step 0: Session-reminder conflict resolution (decide ONCE)

Before doing anything else, settle this policy now and do not re-litigate it at any gate:

**`→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).` / `→ MANDATORY GATE` markers fire regardless of session-reminders, permission mode, or prior approval patterns.** Auto / acceptEdits / bypassPermissions modes, reminders saying "work without stopping" / "continue without asking" / "minimize clarifying questions," and compaction summaries showing the user approving every prior gate do NOT exempt you from invoking `ask_user_question` at a gate. They apply only to your discretionary clarifications.

If you find yourself reasoning "the user has been approving everything, so I can skip this gate" or "auto-mode is on, so I should minimize questions" — that reasoning IS the failure mode. STOP and fire the gate.

Full framework rule: `../orchestrator-framework/references/orchestrator-patterns.md` § 2 and § 2.1.

### Step 1: Load Framework Patterns

**Read the framework reference file NOW using the `read` tool:**

1. `../orchestrator-framework/references/orchestrator-patterns.md` - Delegation rules, interactive mode, state schema, initialization, context passing, issue resolution

### Step 2: Initialize Workflow

1. **Capture the clock**: run `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` via Bash NOW — you do NOT know the time from context. Every timestamp written this turn (`created`, `updated`, `generated`, `phases[].started`) uses this value. Date-only or `T00:00:00Z` values are the documented failure mode (orchestrator-patterns.md § 4 Timestamp Rule). Re-run `date` in later turns before writing timestamps.
2. **Create Task Items**: Use `todo({ action: "create", ... })` for all phases (see Phase Configuration), then set dependencies with `todo({ action: "update", ... }) addBlockedBy`
3. **Create Task Directory**: `.maister/tasks/performance/YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/`
4. **Create Subdirectories**: `analysis/`, `analysis/user-profiling-data/`, `implementation/`, `verification/`
5. **Initialize State**: Create `orchestrator-state.yml` with performance context
6. **Set up Operator Dashboard** (orchestrator-patterns.md § 8) — first read `.maister/config.yml` and set `orchestrator.options.html_output` (default true if the file/key is absent). **When `html_output` is false, SKIP this entire step** — no `dashboard.html`, no `dashboard-data.js`, no browser auto-open — and proceed. Otherwise: copy `../orchestrator-framework/assets/dashboard.html` to the task root as `dashboard.html`, write the initial `dashboard-data.js` (all phases pending, `task.type: "performance"`), then **auto-open it in the user's browser** (`open` / `xdg-open` / `start` per platform, passing the plain absolute filesystem path — NEVER a hand-built `file://` URL; on failure just print the path — never block). On resume: re-copy `dashboard.html` only if missing; regenerate `dashboard-data.js` from state; then auto-open it in the browser again (same opener as a new task — the OS focuses an already-open tab rather than duplicating).
7. **Discover project documentation**: Read `.maister/docs/INDEX.md` (if exists), extract ALL file paths from the "Project Documentation" section — includes predefined docs AND any user-added project docs. Store as `project_context.project_doc_paths` in state.

**Output**:
```
Performance Orchestrator Started

Task: [performance issue description]
Directory: [task-path]
Dashboard: open [task-path]/dashboard.html in a browser to monitor progress

Starting Phase 1: Codebase Analysis...
```

---

## Operator Visibility (applies to every phase)

> **Config gate**: these rules assume `options.html_output` is true (read from `.maister/config.yml` at init, default true). When **false**: skip the Dashboard-upkeep rule entirely (no dashboard files, no browser open, no rewrites) and the HTML-companions rule (do NOT pass `html_style_guide_path`; subagents write md only). The Artifact Summary Contract (§ 7 TL;DR blocks) and `phase_summaries` in state stay active either way.

Cross-cutting rules from `orchestrator-patterns.md` (same as the development orchestrator):

1. **Artifact Summary Contract (§ 7)**: every artifact-writing subagent prompt MUST include the contract instruction (artifacts open with TL;DR / Key Decisions / Open Questions & Risks). At context extraction, lift `decisions`, `risks`, and `artifacts` into `phase_summaries.[phase]` — verbatim, never re-summarized.
2. **Dashboard upkeep (§ 8)**: rewrite `dashboard-data.js` at every phase START (mark `in_progress` before delegating), **BEFORE firing every exit gate** (register the finished phase's artifacts/summary/decisions/risks — the operator reviews them on the dashboard while answering; status stays `in_progress` until the gate passes), after every phase completion (including skipped phases, with reason), every gate decision, every verification cycle, and at finalization. Every rewrite starts with `date -u` (one call per turn). It is a terse projection of state — never duplicate artifact content into it.
3. **HTML companions (§ 9)**: pass `html_style_guide_path` (absolute path to `../orchestrator-framework/references/html-report-style.md`) to specification-creator, implementation-planner, and implementation-verifier. Register returned `html_path` values in `phase_summaries.[phase].artifacts[].html` so the dashboard hero cards link HTML first.
4. **icon_hint values** per phase: 1 `analysis`, 2 `analysis`, 3 `spec`, 4 `verify`, 5 `plan`, 6 `code`, 7 `verify`, 8 `verify`, 9 `done`.

## When to Use

Use for:
- Application slow (response time issues, high latency)
- Need systematic bottleneck identification and resolution
- Want static code analysis for performance anti-patterns
- Have user-provided profiling data to act on
- Database query optimization needed
- Algorithm or I/O inefficiencies suspected

**DO NOT use for**: New features, bug fixes, refactoring without performance goals.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Static Analysis First**: Read code to detect patterns. Don't try to run profiling tools.
2. **User Data Welcome**: Incorporate user-provided profiling data when available
3. **Reuse Standard Phases**: Use proven specification/planning/implementation/verification pipeline
4. **Conservative Estimates**: Provide improvement ranges, not false precision
5. **Practical Optimizations**: Focus on patterns the agent CAN detect and fix

## Phase Configuration

| Phase | content | activeForm | Agent/Skill |
|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | "Analyze codebase" | "Analyzing codebase" | codebase-analyzer |
| 2 | "Analyze performance bottlenecks" | "Analyzing performance bottlenecks" | bottleneck-analyzer |
| 3 | "Gather requirements & create specification" | "Gathering requirements & creating specification" | specification-creator |
| 4 | "Audit specification" | "Auditing specification" | spec-auditor (conditional) |
| 5 | "Plan implementation" | "Planning implementation" | implementation-planner |
| 6 | "Execute implementation" | "Executing implementation" | implementation-plan-executor |
| 7 | "Prompt verification options" | "Prompting verification options" | Direct |
| 8 | "Verify implementation & resolve issues" | "Verifying implementation" | implementation-verifier |
| 9 | "Finalize workflow" | "Finalizing workflow" | Direct |

---

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis & Clarifications

**Purpose**: Comprehensive codebase exploration for performance context, followed by scope/requirements clarification
**Execute**:
1. inline skill `maister-codebase-analyzer`
2. Update state with analysis results
3. Direct - use ask_user_question for max 5 critical clarifying questions about performance concerns, hotspots, and optimization goals
4. Save clarifications to `analysis/clarifications.md`
**Output**: `analysis/codebase-analysis.md`, `analysis/clarifications.md`
**State**: Update `performance_context.phase_summaries.codebase_analysis`, `task_context.clarifications_resolved`

Pass `task_type="enhancement"` and the performance-focused description. The codebase-analyzer adaptively selects parallel `scout` subagents based on task complexity. For performance tasks, the description should guide agents toward: database query patterns, hot code paths, I/O operations, caching layers, connection management, schema/migration files.

→ **AUTO-CONTINUE** — Do NOT end turn, do NOT prompt user. Proceed immediately to Phase 2.

---

### Phase 2: Static Performance Analysis

**Purpose**: Identify bottlenecks through static code analysis + optional user profiling data
**Execute**: subagent tool - `maister-bottleneck-analyzer` subagent
**Output**: `analysis/performance-analysis.md`
**State**: Update `performance_context.bottlenecks_identified`, `performance_context.user_data_available`, `performance_context.bottleneck_priorities`

**Process**:
1. Check if `analysis/user-profiling-data/` contains any files
2. If empty, use ask_user_question:
   - Question: "Do you have profiling data to provide (flame graphs, APM screenshots, slow query logs)?"
   - Options: "Yes, let me add files to analysis/user-profiling-data/" | "No, proceed with static analysis only"
3. If user chooses to add files, wait for them, then proceed

**ANTI-PATTERN — DO NOT DO THIS:**
- ❌ "Let me analyze the bottlenecks myself..." — STOP. Delegate to bottleneck-analyzer.
- ❌ "I'll grep for N+1 patterns..." — STOP. Delegate to bottleneck-analyzer.

**INVOKE NOW** — subagent tool call:

4. subagent tool - `maister-bottleneck-analyzer` subagent

**Context to pass**: task_path, description, codebase analysis summary from Phase 1, user data paths (if any)

**SELF-CHECK**: Did you just invoke the subagent tool with `maister-bottleneck-analyzer`? Or did you start analyzing code yourself? If the latter, STOP and invoke the subagent tool.

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - "Performance analysis complete. [N] bottlenecks identified ([P0 count] P0, [P1 count] P1). Continue to specification?"

---

### Phase 3: Requirements & Specification

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 2 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Gather optimization requirements and create specification
**Output**: `analysis/requirements.md`, `implementation/spec.md`
**State**: Update `performance_context.phase_summaries.specification`

**Part A — Requirements Gathering (inline)**:

1. Present bottleneck summary from Phase 2 to user
2. Use ask_user_question for optimization priorities:
   - Which bottleneck priorities to address? (All P0+P1, P0 only, specific ones)
   - Any constraints? (backward compatibility, memory limits, no new dependencies)
   - Performance targets? (specific response time goals, if known)
3. Save gathered requirements to `analysis/requirements.md` with: performance issue description, bottleneck analysis summary, optimization priorities, constraints, targets

**Part B — Specification Creation (subagent)**:

📋 **Standards Discovery**: Read `.maister/docs/INDEX.md` before creating spec.

**ANTI-PATTERN — DO NOT DO THIS:**
- ❌ "Let me create the specification..." — STOP. Delegate to specification-creator.
- ❌ "I'll write the spec based on the analysis..." — STOP. Delegate to specification-creator.

**INVOKE NOW** — subagent tool call:

4. subagent tool - `maister-specification-creator` subagent

**Context to pass**: task_path, task_type="performance", task_description, requirements_path (analysis/requirements.md), project_context_paths (INDEX.md + project_doc_paths from state — all discovered project docs), phase_summaries (codebase_analysis, bottleneck_analysis), html_style_guide_path (for the spec.html companion)

**SELF-CHECK**: Did you just invoke the subagent tool with `maister-specification-creator`? Or did you start writing spec.md yourself? If the latter, STOP and invoke the subagent tool.

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - Display executive summary before asking. Read `implementation/spec.md` and extract: optimization targets, approach chosen, number of changes planned, expected impact. Format as brief overview then "Continue to specification audit?"

---

### Phase 4: Specification Audit (Conditional)

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 3 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Independent review of optimization specification
**Execute**: subagent tool - `maister-spec-auditor` subagent
**Output**: `verification/spec-audit.md`
**State**: Update `options.spec_audit_enabled`

**Run if**: >5 optimizations planned, spec >50 lines, or user requests
**Skip if**: Simple optimization (1-3 changes)

ask_user_question to decide - "Run specification audit?"

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - Display executive summary before asking. Read `verification/spec-audit.md` and extract: overall verdict, issue counts by severity, top findings. Format as brief overview then "Continue to implementation planning?"

---

### Phase 5: Implementation Planning

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 4 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Break optimization specification into implementation steps

📋 **Standards Discovery**: Read `.maister/docs/INDEX.md` before planning.

**ANTI-PATTERN — DO NOT DO THIS:**
- ❌ "Let me create the implementation plan..." — STOP. Delegate to implementation-planner.
- ❌ "I'll break this into optimization steps..." — STOP. Delegate to implementation-planner.

**INVOKE NOW** — subagent tool call:

**Execute**: subagent tool - `maister-implementation-planner` subagent
**Output**: `implementation/implementation-plan.md`
**State**: Update task groups and dependencies

**Context to pass**: task_path, task_type="performance", task_description, phase_summaries (specification, bottleneck_analysis, codebase_analysis), html_style_guide_path (for the implementation-plan.html companion)

**SELF-CHECK**: Did you just invoke the subagent tool with `maister-implementation-planner`? Or did you start writing the plan yourself? If the latter, STOP and invoke the subagent tool.

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - Display executive summary before asking. Read `implementation/implementation-plan.md` and extract: number of task groups, total steps, key dependencies, optimization sequence. Format as brief overview then "Continue to implementation?"

---

### Phase 6: Implementation

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 5 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Execute the optimization plan

📋 **Standards Discovery**: Implementation reads `.maister/docs/INDEX.md` continuously.

**ANTI-PATTERN — DO NOT DO THIS:**
- ❌ "Let me implement this directly..." — STOP. Delegate to implementation-plan-executor.
- ❌ "This is simple enough to code inline..." — STOP. Simplicity is NOT a reason to skip delegation.

**INVOKE NOW** — inline skill execution:

**Execute**: inline skill `maister-implementation-plan-executor`
**Output**: Implemented optimizations, `implementation/work-log.md`
**State**: Update implementation progress, extract phase_summaries.implementation

**SELF-CHECK**: Did you just invoke the inline skill `maister-implementation-plan-executor`? Or did you start writing code yourself? If the latter, STOP immediately and invoke the inline skill loading instead.

**⚠️ POST-IMPLEMENTATION CONTINUATION** — After the skill completes and returns control:
1. **HTML plan reconciliation** (backstop for syncs missed during waves): if `implementation/implementation-plan.html` exists, for every group whose md checkboxes are all `[x]`, run the executor's idempotent marker-flip command (`sed` flipping `data-step="N\.[0-9]*" class="step todo"` and `data-group="N" class="group todo"` to `done`). VERIFY: when all md steps are checked, `grep -c 'class="step todo"' implementation/implementation-plan.html` must return 0.
2. Read `orchestrator-state.yml` to confirm you are the orchestrator
3. Update state: add Phase 6 to `completed_phases`
4. Proceed to Phase 7

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - Display executive summary before asking. Extract from `phase_summaries.implementation` and `implementation/work-log.md`: optimizations applied, files changed, test results, any known issues. Format as brief overview then "Continue to verification?"

---

### Phase 7: Verification Options

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 6 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Determine which verification checks to run
**Execute**: Direct - use ask_user_question for options
**Output**: Updated state with verification options
**State**: Set `options.code_review_enabled`, `options.pragmatic_review_enabled`, `options.production_check_enabled`, `options.reality_check_enabled`

**Always enabled**: Reality check, pragmatic review
**Auto-set**: `skip_test_suite: true` (full test suite already passed during implementation phase; cleared before re-verification if fixes are applied)

ask_user_question with multiselect - "Which additional verification checks?"
  - "Code review" (recommended)
  - "Production readiness check"

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - "Options selected. Continue to Phase 8?"

---

### Phase 8: Verification & Issue Resolution

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 7 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Comprehensive implementation verification with user-driven fix cycles
**Output**: `verification/implementation-verification.md`, optional review reports
**State**: Update `verification_context`

**Execute**:

**Step 1**: Invoke inline skill `maister-implementation-verifier`

**Step 2**: Display detailed issue breakdown grouped by category and severity (critical/warning/info), listing location, description, and fixability for each.

**Step 3**: Gate on verification status:
- `status: passed` → skip to Pause
- `status: passed_with_issues` or `failed` → enter user-driven fix loop (Step 4)

**Step 4**: User-driven fix loop (max 3 iterations):
1. Present all critical + warning issues as a numbered list
2. ask_user_question — "Which issues should I fix?" with options: "Fix all fixable issues" / "Let me choose specific issues" / "Skip fixes, proceed as-is"
3. Fix selected issues
4. After fixes: set `skip_test_suite: false` (code changed, tests must re-run)
5. ask_user_question — "Re-run verification to check fixes?" with options: "Yes, re-run verification" / "No, proceed to next phase"
6. If re-run → re-invoke `maister-implementation-verifier` → return to Step 2

→ **MANDATORY GATE** — fires regardless of permission mode, session-reminders, or prior approval patterns. Invoke `ask_user_question` now. Proceeding without a user response is a protocol violation (orchestrator-patterns.md § 2 / § 2.1).

ask_user_question - Display executive summary: total issues found, issues fixed, issues remaining by severity. Then "Continue to finalization?"

---

### Phase 9: Finalization

> **Phase entry self-check**: Before executing this phase, locate the `ask_user_question` tool call from Phase 8 in this conversation. If you cannot point to its call ID, STOP and fire that gate now. State updates (`completed_phases`, `todo({ action: "update", ... })`) without a corresponding `ask_user_question` call are protocol violations — never paper over a missed gate by updating state.

**Purpose**: Complete workflow and provide next steps
**Execute**: Direct - create summary, update state, guide commit
**Output**: Workflow summary
**State**: Set `task.status: completed`

**Process**:
1. Create workflow summary (bottlenecks found, optimizations implemented, verification result)
2. Update task status to "completed"
3. Provide commit message template
4. Guide performance-specific next steps:
   - Run the application and verify improvements manually
   - Consider profiling with runtime tools to measure actual impact
   - Monitor production metrics after deployment
   - Address remaining P2/P3 bottlenecks if needed

→ End of workflow
